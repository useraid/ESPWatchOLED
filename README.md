## Hardware
***This Design is deprecated and a new design is being worked on***

Watch can be made on a prototype board or using the PCB Gerber Files(You will need to source SMD Components for that though)

### Components Required
- ESP12F - Microprocessor for WiFi and Smart Features
- AMS1117 3.3V - Voltage Regulator
- DS1302Z IC - RTC Timer IC
- Crystal Oscillator - 32.768 KHz
- Connection Wires - Enamel Coated or Jumpers
- 0.96" SSD1306 OLED Display - Watch Screen

*Note - Charging and battery circuit yet to be implemented. That will most likely be a TP4056 Charging Module with a 3.7V Lipo (probably 300 mAH)*

## Software
***Due to the complex nature of the sofftware, it'll be spinned off into a new project UOS***

The Code is written in Arduino IDE(WIP). The ESP8266 libraries need to be added using the board manager

### Prerequisites 
- Arduino IDE
- Drivers for whatever ISP Programmers you are using. (I'll be using a NODEMCU board to write the code to the ESP12F so CP2102 Drivers needed)

### Currently WIP ðŸš§

If you have any problems in the implementation or just ever need general help with this project, make an issue regarding the same.
